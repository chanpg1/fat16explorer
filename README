Hardware/OS course project.  With supplied java based framework
implemented y86 isa instruction sets and then wrote y86 
assembly to run within simulated cpu.

Three different versions of 5 stage cpu were implemented and
can be selected on start up.   Run from eclipse and 
select one of the cpu implementations, the simplest one
is the sequential that operates sequentially and stalls
on missing inputs, the most complex is the 5 stage 
pipleline that implements parallel pipelines with
data forwarding and branch prediction.
